## About
This repo is a site about myself to practice basic web development concepts. This repo will evolve over time as I continue through my university course.

## Recommended Tools
Publishing web pages with GitHub Pages is very easy! All you need is:

- [A GitHub Account](github.com)

Once you have completed putting together a web page with your preffered language all you have to do is select a GitHub Pages option and publish. Very simple!
